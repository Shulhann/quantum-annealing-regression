# About this repository

This repository focuses on implementing linear and polynomial regression using quantum annealing, specifically leveraging Dwave Systems' service.

The repository is structured around two primary components: main.ipynb and function.py. The main.ipynb notebook is used to execute the regression tasks, while function.py contains essential utility functions that support the regression implementation.

# How to run

Install all the dependencies and run main.ipynb jupyter file
